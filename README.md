# Leogram

>Leo, what are you doing?<br />
Magic, Pipes. Real magic. 😎<br />
Why are you using a computer?! Are you mad?! You know that attracts monsters!<br />
That's my magic, I'm working on something so they can't track us. Besides, we are at camp. No lion chihuahas can't enter here. Chill out and eat an enchilada.

Umm... guys... I'm trying to decide what to write for the README file to explain this project. Could you please not do this now?

Bro, what are you doing at my laptop? What are you typing?

>Fine! Still, what is this suppose to be? 😠<br />
This? Behold! LEOGRAM!<br />
What?<br />
The first social app for half-bloods.<br />
The first...? What? *You* know we can't use cellphones outside of camp, right?<br />
Or can we? 😏 <br />
This is ridiculous! Just like the Wii control for Argo II! <br />
Hey! You told me it was genius! 😁 <br />
I did not such thing. 😡

Piper, don't worry, we got it handle. Leo, stop typing in my laptop!

As I was saying, this is an app we are creating for half-bloods so they can talk and post things without the constant danger of monsters.

>So they can...? *We* have Iris messages! We don't need cellphones!<br />
And we have to pay each time to Rainbow Girl in order to send messages, Pipes. I have to save some money, girl. Speaking of money, can you lend me some drachmas so I can to talk to...?<br />
It is dumb! 🙄<br />
It is genius! 😁<br />

Guys, please! Leo, stop!

The idea, Piper, is that half-bloods would no longer need to send Iris messages each time to talk to someone. It will be easier with this new app. And for the first time demigods will be able to use cellphones outside of camp thanks to this new magic we are developing. 

Give me back my laptop, Leo. I know what to write now.
